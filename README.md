## 🧪 Testing with Postman

1. Open **Postman** and set the base URL:  
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/students
   ```

2. Available requests:
   - `POST /students` → Add student  
   - `GET /students` → Get all students  
   - `GET /students/:id` → Get student by ID  
   - `PUT /students/:id` → Update student  
   - `DELETE /students/:id` → Delete student  

3. Set request **Body → raw → JSON** for POST/PUT requests.  
4. For GET/PUT/DELETE by ID, use the `_id` value from POST response.

## 🧰 Troubleshooting
- **MongoDB connection error** → Make sure `mongod` is running.  
- **CastError (ObjectId)** → Invalid MongoDB `_id`.  
- **Validation error** → Ensure all required fields (`name`, `age`, `course`) are provided.
